# Random Password Generator

This is a simple application that generates a random password based on user preferences. The application utilizes arrays, functions, conditional statements, and a for loop to ensure a robust and secure password generation process.

## Features

- Generates random passwords based on user preferences
- Requires at least 8 characters in the password
- Supports uppercase, lowercase, numerical, and special characters
- Utilizes a for loop to select characters from each array
- Ensures the password meets the desired length

## Implementation Details

The application consists of the following key components:

### Arrays

To facilitate the password generation process, four arrays were created to store different character sets:
- Uppercase characters
- Lowercase characters
- Numerical characters
- Special characters

These arrays provide a diverse range of characters to choose from when generating the random password.

### Password Generation Function

The `writePassword` function is responsible for generating the random password. It takes into consideration the user's preferences, such as the desired length and character types.

The function includes conditional statements to enforce password length requirements, prompting the user if the length is less than 8 or greater than 128 characters. It also prompts the user to include uppercase, lowercase, special, or numerical characters based on their preferences.

By utilizing a for loop, the function selects characters from each array based on the user's prompts, resulting in a random and secure password.

## Getting Started

To use the Random Password Generator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
3. Click the "Generate Password" button to initiate the password generation process.
4. Follow the prompts and provide the necessary information, such as the desired password length and character preferences.
5. Once all prompts are answered, the generated password will be displayed on the screen.

## Future Enhancements

While the current implementation fulfills the basic requirements of generating random passwords, there are several potential areas for future enhancements:

- Implementing additional validation checks to ensure the user provides valid inputs.
- Allowing the user to specify the exclusion of certain characters.
- Adding the ability to save generated passwords for future reference.
- Providing an option to copy the generated password to the clipboard.
- Incorporating additional password complexity options, such as requiring a minimum number of characters from each character set.
